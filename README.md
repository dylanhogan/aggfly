# clim-agg
A more permanent home for my climate data aggregation code

Will add docs and instructions in the next few weeks as I have time. For questions in the meantime, feel free to email me at `dth2133@columbia.edu`.

The `environment.yml` file provides the packages you need. You can refer to the [conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) if you need help using it.
